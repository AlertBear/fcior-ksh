# This file defines test suite configuration variables.It contains
# three sections:
#       1) Common variables
#       2) Configuration variables used in test cases with only one root domain, such as
#          functional_test01, functional_test02, functional_test04, stress_test01
#       3) Configuration variables used in test cases with multiple root domains, such as
#          functional_test03, functional_test05, functional_test06, stress_test02
#
# Test user need to modify section #2 when test functional_test01, functional_test02,
# functional_test04 and stress_test01
#
# Except the #2 variables may used in functional_test03,functional_test05, functional_test06
# and stress_test02, Test user also need to modify section #3
#

# SECTION 1: 
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#

# 
# Vdbench PATH, has default value, could custom by test user.
# It should be identical with the vdbench files test user decompressd.
#
VDBENCH_PATH=/export/home/vdbench

# 
# The test root domains and io domain will be cloned by a source domain.
#
# If test user has finished creating the root domains and io domain, this config 
# var should be ignored.
#
# If test user execute "run_test --configure" to create root domains and io domains.
# All test domains will be cloned from this source domain.
#
SOURCE_DOMAIN=fc

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SECTION 2: 
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#

#
# Use in all the test cases.
# The root domain including name and password to be used. There are two usages.
# If the case has only one root domain to use, use this domain as the root domain.
# If the case has two root domain to use, use this domain as the first root domain.
# Test user should know the password is the same as source domain's if cloned from 
# the source domain, else, modify the password as your own.

# Use in all the test cases.
# PF from the root domain NPRD_A defined above
#

#
# Only use in functional_test02.
# This is another port of the FC device where PF_A affiliated
#

#
# Use in all the test cases.
# The IO domain including name and password to be used in the functional tests and the stress test01.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SECTION 3: 
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#

#
# Use in functional_test04, functional_test05, functional_test06, stress_02
# The second root domain including name and password to be used in the case.
# Test user should know the password is the same as source domain's if cloned 
# from the source domain, else, modify the password as you own.
# Only when the case needs two root domains should this domain be used as the second root domain.

# Default io domains name were defined below, user can change them.
# No need to define {IOD_8...IOD_14} while testing Emulex FC card, since maxvfs value is 8 in Emulex PF.
